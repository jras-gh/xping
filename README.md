xping
=====

xping is a simple PING program continiously probing multiple hosts
using ICMP-ECHO. As packets are received dots are printed on the screen.
Hosts not responding before next packet is due will get a questionmark
in the display:

           192.0.2.1 .....................................
           192.0.2.2 ????.????????????.???.?.?............
           192.0.2.3 .....................................
           192.0.2.4 .....................................

It is similar to the second visual display in "my traceroute's" (aka mtr)
and provide a way to spot subtle availability changes.


Binary packages
---------------

Prebuilt amd64 binary packages for Debian and Arch Linux are available
from http://martin.topholm.eu/pub/xping .

To use as an `apt(8)` repository:

    printf "\ndeb http://martin.topholm.eu/pub/xping/debian /\n" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    curl -# http://martin.topholm.eu/082a0808.asc | apt-key add -

To use as a `pacman(8)` repository

    printf "\n[xping]\nServer = http://martin.topholm.eu/pub/xping/archlinux\n" >> /etc/pacman.conf
    curl -# http://martin.topholm.eu/082a0808.asc | pacman-key --add - && \
        pacman-key --lsign-key BCEBFB5B082A0808


Building
--------

xping hasn't surrendered to autoconf yet, but it should build on Linux,
FreeBSD and OSX. There are a few options in the Makefile that can be
enabled by uncommenting them. OSX users with Terminal.app may wish to
use ncurses.

xping depends on libevent, if you don't have it you can uncomment the
"static linking" option in the Makefile to have it downloaded and linked
static into xping. OSX doesn't use -lrt, but may need
-Wno-deprecated-declarations in order to build WITH_SSL.

    vi Makefile
    make
    make install

N.B. xping will be installed set-uid because most platforms requires
superuser privileges to open RAW sockets. xping drops the privileges
when it has opened the sockets.
